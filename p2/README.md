NBA PLAYER DATABASE

<!--
[NBA: Player Database](website url no quotes) -->

# Project Description:

This is a NBA Player Database, which includes live stats and league leaders. This project was built using JavaScript, React.js, JSX, Bootstrap, and CSS. I will be using the NBA's API data to display brief player bio's/stats on the screen. My goal is to make this database feel as dynamic and authenic as possible. To help conceptualize my project, I will be using React Router to help navigate back and forth through my pages, CSS grid, and flex for the structoring of each component, Storybook for the button I will be using throughout my site, and some JavaScripit to help organize my data. The user must get at least 8 answers correct, to be crowned the newest Pokemon Master.

# API:

I will be using these NBA API's (https://rapidapi.com/blog/nba-basketball-stats-api/), (https://nba-players.herokuapp.com/)

# MVP:

- For MVP, I will have all my data recieved from the API implemented into each of my components need-be.

- Majority of my paths the content will be rendering on their specificed page.

- I will have my js logic configured and for my alphabetizing my list for my Player List page.

- All of my 5 storybook stories will be written out and placed within my website.

- All of my media queries will be set/ layouts for Desktop, iPhone X, iPad, and iPad Pro fully set.

- My website will be hosted on surge upon completion of MVP.

# Post-MVP:

My plan is to have event listeners built-in for all my storybook buttons on page.
Another thing I will like to include is some Bootstrap to help styling.
I will also have a UX student examine/Software Engineer critique my app, to see how I can improve the users experience.
References for each source will be included.
In additon, I will be be including a favicon in place this will bring that more organic website feel.
