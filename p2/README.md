# Title:

NBA PLAYER DATABASE

<!--
[NBA: Player Database](website url no quotes) -->

# Project Description:

This is a NBA Player Database, which includes player list, stats and bio. This project was built using JavaScript, React.js, JSX, Bootstrap, and CSS. I will be using the NBA's API data to display brief player bio's/stats on the screen. My goal is to make this database feel as dynamic and authenic as possible. To help conceptualize my project, I will be using React Router to help navigate back and forth through my pages, CSS grid, and flex for the structoring of each component, Storybook for the button I will be using throughout my site, and some JavaScripit to help organize my data. The user must get at least 8 answers correct, to be crowned the newest Pokemon Master.

# API:

- I will be using this NBA API (https://nba-players.herokuapp.com/)

- All of my 5 storybook stories will be written out and placed within my website.
